* When adding trains, administrators are able to submit the following:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
  * This app is coded to calculate when the next train will arrive; this is relative to the current time.
  
  * Users from many different machines are able to view same train times.
